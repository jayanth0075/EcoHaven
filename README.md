 Why?

EcoHaven addresses the growing need for a dedicated platform where young people can learn, share, and take action towards sustainable living. With climate change being one of the biggest challenges of our generation, we created a space that makes eco-friendly living accessible, engaging, and community-driven.

 What?

## Git LFS and ignored files

This repository excludes common IDE, dependency, build, and virtual environment files. If you need to add large binary files (>100MB) consider using Git LFS instead of committing them directly.

Quick setup for contributors:

1. Install Git LFS: https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Initialize LFS in your clone:

	git lfs install

3. Track large file types (example):

	git lfs track "*.zip"

4. Commit the .gitattributes that Git LFS creates and push as normal.

Common files you should not commit are already listed in `.gitignore` (IDE settings, node_modules, .venv, build output, etc.).

EcoHaven is a community-driven platform focused on wellness and eco-friendly living for young people. It provides:

- Community Feed - Share eco-friendly tips and stories
- Challenges - Participate in sustainability challenges

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
